Proxy is a middleware server. Let's call client `C`, server `S`, proxy `P`. The relationship of them is like:

![5-1](https://github.com/Arichy/blogs/blob/main/docs/socks5/imgs/5-1.png?raw=true)

The job of proxy is to forward data. Assume there are some barriers between C and S (like the Great Fire Wall) forbidding the communication, but C and P, P and S could communicate freely, then we can use P to help the communication between C and S.

<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc1928.txt.pdf" target="_blank">socks5</a> is a proxy protocol between the application layer and transport layer, so socks5 uses TCP to transmit HTTP message.

Let's take the basic socks5 communication without authentication as an example:

1. client sends a handshake message：

```
                   +----+----------+----------+
                   |VER | NMETHODS | METHODS  |
                   +----+----------+----------+
                   | 1  |    1     | 1 to 255 |
                   +----+----------+----------+
```

The number in second line is neither value nor number range but length. The number `1` under `VER` indicates that the length of `VER` is 1 byte. The length of `METHODS` is from 1 to 255 bytes.

- 1st byte: `VER`, is the version number. For socks5, the value is `0x05`.
- 2nd byte: `NMETHODS`, is the count of supported authentication methods by client.
- From the 3rd byte, every byte represents an authentication method.

Because the data is binary and is read as byte one by one, it's crucial to distinguish the boundaries. So we use a specific byte to represent the length `n` of a field, and use the following `n` byte(s) to represent the value of the field, which is a very common way.

For example, considering the string `127.0.0.14000`, it takes 13 bytes. The program cannot tell which part is ip and which is port when reading it. But given the string `09127.0.0.14000`with a rule: the former 2 bytes represent the length of ip, it's easy to tell that `127.0.0.1` is ip while `4000` is port because it says the first 9 bytes is ip.

2. proxy returns a response：

```

                         +----+--------+
                         |VER | METHOD |
                         +----+--------+
                         | 1  |   1    |
                         +----+--------+
```

- 1st byte: the same, `0x05`。
- 2nd byte: METHOD, is the authentication method chosen by server. `0x00` means that it does not need any authentication.

3. client sends a request：

```
        +----+-----+-------+------+----------+----------+
        |VER | CMD |  RSV  | ATYP | DST.ADDR | DST.PORT |
        +----+-----+-------+------+----------+----------+
        | 1  |  1  | X'00' |  1   | Variable |    2     |
        +----+-----+-------+------+----------+----------+
```

After the connection via handshake, client is going to send requests to proxy. Since it's a proxy, client needs to tell proxy the target ip and port it wants the data to be sent to. Otherwise proxy does not know where to forward data.

- VER: same.
- CMD: the command of the socks session
  - `0x01` CONNECT. **We'll only talk about it in this article.**
  - `0x02` BIND
  - `0x03` UDP forward
- RSV: reserved with a value `0x00`
- ATYP: the type of target server address. DST.ADDR is the ip while DST.PORT is the port.
  - `0x01` means IPv4, with it DST.ADDR takes 4 bytes. For example, ATYP + DST.ADDR + DST.PORT: `01 c0 a8 01 01`means the ip of target server is `192.168.1.1`
  - `0x03` means domain. Due to the unfixed length of domains, the length of DST.ADDR is unfixed as well. Remember how to transmit data with unfixed size? Yes, length first byte. So in this case, the first byte of DST.ADDR represents the length `n` of the domain , while the following `n` bytes represent domain. For example, ATYP + DST.ADDR + DST.PORT: `03 09 62 61 69 64 75 2e 63 6f 6d 01 bb` means the domain is `baidu.com`, and the port is `443`.
  - `0x04` means IPv6. DST.ADDR takes 16 bytes.

4. proxy returns a response

```
        +----+-----+-------+------+----------+----------+
        |VER | REP |  RSV  | ATYP | BND.ADDR | BND.PORT |
        +----+-----+-------+------+----------+----------+
        | 1  |  1  | X'00' |  1   | Variable |    2     |
        +----+-----+-------+------+----------+----------+
```

- REP: response status. `0x00` means success.
- ATYPE: address type of proxy .
- BND.ADDR is the ip of proxy，BND.PORT is the port.

BND.ADDR and BND.PORT is the ip address and port of proxy, not target server. Proxy uses this ip-port to communicate with target server. **For `connect` command, the 2 values could be set to 0 in basic scenario because client does not care which ip-port is used by proxy to communicate with server.**

5. start forwarding data
   After the initialize process above, client would send the real data to proxy, while proxy forwards it to target server. In a similar way, target server would send the response to proxy, while proxy forwards to client. These forwarding processes are just via TCP protocol we talked above.
