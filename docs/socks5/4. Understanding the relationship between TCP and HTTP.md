As is known to us, TCP/IP is based on the 4 layers model, and HTTP is at the application layer while TCP is at the transport layer.
**HTTP is based on TCP**

How to understand the phrase `based on`?

Let's build a TCP server:

```javascript
// server.js
const net = require('net');

const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  socket.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(data.toString());
  });
});

server.listen(4001);
```

Then we we visit `localhost:4001` on browser, the console would print logs as below:
![HTTP request message](https://github.com/Arichy/blogs/blob/main/docs/socks5/imgs/4-1.png?raw=true)

The server received a string with an HTTP request message content. In the meanwhile, the browser will be loading status because server does not return any response.

Let's update server code to return an HTTP response:

```javascript
// server.js
const net = require('net');

const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  socket.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(data.toString());
    const html = `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>hello</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div style="color:skyblue;">hello world</div>
      </body>
    </html>`;

    const body = Buffer.from(html); // body is for calculating length

    const rawResponse =
      'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n' +
      'Content-Type: text/html\r\n' +
      `Content-Length: ${html.length}\r\n` +
      '\r\n\r\n' +
      body;

    socket.write(rawResponse);
  });
});

server.listen(4001);

```

Now we visit it again:

<img src="https://github.com/Arichy/blogs/blob/main/docs/socks5/imgs/4-2.png?raw=true" style="border:1px solid skyblue" />

It shows the html content in response. That's the essence of HTTP: a request has a corresponding response, while they are both text.

Overall, TCP is a protocol to control transmission. However, it does not care the detail of transmitted content. The detail is controlled by the high level (application) protocols, such as HTTP. Similarly, client and server usually use JSON to communicate with each other. The JSON format is just a "protocol" based on HTTP.

Besides, the port of HTTP is actually the port of TCP.
