As a frontend engineer, we should be very familiar with HTTP. Whether sending HTTP requests or using `express` , `koa` to develop an HTTP server, we're using HTTP.
But maybe we're not so familiar with TCP. Now I'll introduce how to develop a TCP server and a TCP client in Node.js simply.

#### Server

```javascript
// server.js
const net = require('net');

const server = net.createServer(socket => {
  socket.on('data', data => {
    console.log('data from client:', data);
    socket.write('Hello from server.');
  });
});

server.listen(4001);
```

#### Client

```javascript
// client.js
const net = require('net');

const socket = net.connect(4001, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  socket.write('Hello from client');
});

socket.on('data', data => {
  console.log('data from server:', data);
});
```

As shown in the figure, the `createServer` method of `net` module is actually to create a TCP server. The TCP server and client use a pair of socket to communicate with each other. Socket is a duplex, which is a readable and writeable stream. If call `sockatA.write(data)`, `socketB` would receive `data`.

Let's run `node server.js` , and then run `node client.js`. The result is below:

According the the introduce of Buffer in last article, we know that server received the message from client: `Hello from client`, and sent a message `Hello from server` to client, in a way of TPC transmission.
