The computer handles binary data at low level, the same as the progress of network transmission.
Node.js offers the `Buffer` class to handle binary data. A buffer object is like an array with a byte as an item (usually displayed as hex). Here are some frequently-used operations below (the encoding of chars are not under consideration in the series, UTF-8 by default):
- `Buffer.from("hello")`

  Returns `<Buffer 68 65 6c 6c 6f>` , and every item is the ASCII code of the char.

- `Buffer.from([0x00, 0x01, 0x02])`

  Returns `<Buffer 01 02 03>` , and every item is a byte.

- `buffer.slice()` 
  Just like the `slice` of arrays, it splits a part of buffer and returns that.
- `buffer.toString()` 
  Transform the buffer to string, and every one/multiple bytes represent a char.
- `buffer.toJSON()` 
  Transform the buffer to a JSON object, and every item is a decimal number if printed. This is useful when handling blank chars like \r \n because they may not be visible in some logs.

```javascript
let buf = Buffer.from("hello"); // <Buffer 68 65 6c 6c 6f>
console.log(buf.slice(0, 3).toString()); // "hel"
console.log(buf.toJSON()); // { type: 'Buffer', data: [ 104, 101, 108, 108, 111 ] }
```
